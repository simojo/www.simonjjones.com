# Starting my PhD
## Reflections
### 2024-08-22

This week marks the first week of me starting my PhD at CU Boulder. I've met
hundreds of extremely qualified, unique people that I can't even begin to
compare myself to. I'm quickly learning how easy it is to develop *imposter
syndrome*; with everyone being so skilled at such specific things, it's easy to
evaluate oneself based on some arbitrary criteria that may have no grounds being
applied to another's situation.

One example that comes to mind is with my father and I. My father built my
childhood home when he was in his late twenties from scratch. No matter how much
time I spend in the classroom, I **will never** be as good as he is at framing,
drywall, or any of those trades. Yet, he tells me consistently how much he
wishes he were "educated" so that he could have gone farther in life, i.e.
someone with forty plus years of highly specific experience can feel resentful
by the thought of four years of education. What if he had pursued a B.S. instead
of a toolbelt? Things may have been different. Perhaps I wouldn't have found the
same level of satisfaction in school and dropped out, *or maybe* I would have
thrived even more under an "educated" father! The wonderful thing about making
up situations like this is that it will always be in vain. It's not our
responsibility to figure out how to be the most successful in life, we only need
to devote ourselves to diligence and a mindset of contentment, which yields
intrinsic satisfaction.
